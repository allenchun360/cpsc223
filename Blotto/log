This project involved interweaving so many different files to get the code working together. I had to make
sure I was using the functions from strategy and population properly in blotto_ga. Because of the many
different functions and files, I had to be careful with the initial apporach to this project because
working on one part of strategy.c could potentially ruin the code I worked on in blotto_ga or vice versa.
Whenever I outputted a wrong result or had memory allocation issues, it took time figuring out where the
source of the problem was coming from. One of the biggest challenges of this project was conceptually
understanding the way structs and pointers worked, especially in population.c where there were pointers
to arrays of pointers (double star).
