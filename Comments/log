15:00 ESTIMATE
24:00 TOTAL

This project was one of the biggest CS assignments I have received thus far. The lines of code went
almost to over a thousand total. Keeping track of all the variables and states was quite difficult.
I know next time to use more helper functions rather than trying to do everything in main. The hardest
challenge was trying to store each line of input files to arrays that I could later use to print out 
the tags within the comments. Furthermore, the combinations of different input methods required me to
use multiple conditionals to satisfy each situation. Lastly, debugging the many lines of code trying to
match each test case was quite the challenge.
